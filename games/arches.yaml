  2020년 5월, boyfriends Cameron and Devon arrive in the ghost town of Echo to conduct a paranormal investigation. It has been five years since the mass hysteria supposedly left the town completely abandoned. While it does seem empty at first, they realize that something evil still lurks in Echo, evil enough that it has kept the horrors alive.
